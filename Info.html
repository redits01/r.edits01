  <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
   
  <br>
  <p>Behind this account is an average high school student who is passionate about photo editing and graphic design. I enjoy creating automotive-themed wallpapers and visual content for social media.</p>
<br>
<br>
  
  <h2>Tools I Use</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Here are some of the tools I use to create my work:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Photoshop Mobile and Desktop</li>
    <li>Lightroom Mobile and Desktop</li>
    <li>VN Video Editor</li>
    <li>Remove.bg</li>
    <li>Canva</li>
  </ul>
<br>
  <h2>How I got started</h2>
  <br>
  <p>I started taking photos of cars in 2020. A year later, I attempted to edit my first car photo; it looked horrifying, and I gave up. In late 2024, I decided to start over, this time the right way, learning from other creators on YouTube and Instagram. I began an Instagram account and started posting my photos. About a month later, I expanded to creating other content, such as wallpapers, hosting editing competitions, and making reels. I received a lot of support from other creators, which truly inspired me to continue making these projects and not give up. I'm really thankful for that encouragement.</p>
